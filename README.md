# kptrOS
Hobbyist Operating System (UEFI only)
I am learning Advanced C and Assembly as I write this operating system

I recommend using bear to generate compile_commands.json so clangd and any other clang tool can work properly with the source code

## Requirements
- UEFI
- 64 bit computer
- Will to fix whatever might be broken
- LLVM Toolchain
- NASM

## Credits
- Both AMD and Intel X86_64 manuals
- osdev.wiki
- Operating System Development community on Discord
- Whoever else helped me through this project!
